# Tasks & Challenges 

* Entity names in the original Acfrs database are not obvious, i.e., does not always contain a certain word to indicate it's government type (city, town, county). Even some names contains a certain word such as "county", it actually a town. For example: "halifax county" in acfrs is in fact a town (population 1000) of Halifax county (pop more than 30k)

*ACFRs data has government_id (which is called census_id in the ACFRs portal). This is government unit identifier, and is not geo_id that are often used in many census datasets.

Two points above constitute challenges when we need to 1) adding population field in acfrs data, and 2) sort out what type of entities are collected.

* Two main ways to solve the problems: 

- Use a "middle file" to link geo_id and government_ID
- Joining by names and states 

Note on geo ID and government unit: 

*The [census population data use GEOIDs](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html#:~:text=The%20full%20GEOID%20for%20many,codes%2C%20in%20which%20they%20nest.), which are "numeric codes that uniquely identify all administrative/legal and statistical geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data".

```{r}
df_state <- data.frame(state.abb, state.name) %>% 
  add_row(state.abb = "DC", state.name = "District of Columbia")

  select(-c(primgeo_flag, estimatesbase2020, popestimate2021, popestimate2022))

```

## Census Consolidated Cities

```{r}
census_consolidated_city_2020 <- census_all_2020 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% filter(sumlev== 170 | #170 = Consolidated city
                             sumlev == 172) # 172 = Consolidated city -- place within consolidated city

```

## Census cities as counties
```{r}
census_cityAScounty_2020 <- census_all_2020 %>%
# Active government providing primary
#general-purpose functions. See more detail in file FunctionalStatusCode_census.pdf
#  filter(funcstat == "A") %>%
# excluding state & county
  #filter(sumlev != 040) %>% # 40 = summary level state
  filter(sumlev == 050) %>%   # 50 = summary level county
  filter(str_detect(name, "(city)"))
```

# ACFRs General Purpose 2020
```{r}
# 1. get all general purpose entities in acfrs, most contains governmentID
acfrs_general_purpose <- readRDS("data/data_from_dbsite_2020.RDS") %>% 
  filter(category == "General Purpose") %>% 
  select(-c(5:11, category, has_unconfirmed, component_unit_of_id)) %>% 
  mutate(name = str_to_lower(name)) %>% 
  rename(government_ID = census_id) %>% # census_id in Acfrs database is actually government_ID
# some government_ID in ACFRs has 13 characters-> need to add 0
  mutate(government_ID = ifelse(str_length(government_ID) < 14, paste0("0", government_ID), government_ID)) 
```


# Extracting States

### States from ACFRS 2020

```{r}
acfrs_state_2020 <- acfrs_general_purpose %>% filter(str_detect(name, "(state of)|(district of columbia)|(commonwealth)")) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(name, "yap|kosrae")) %>% 

  #clean state names to match with those names in census population data 
  mutate(name = str_remove(name, "state of "),
        name = str_remove(name, "commonwealth of "),
        name = str_remove(name, "government of the ")) %>% 
  #left_join(states_population) %>% 
  #select(-c(year, has_unconfirmed)) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(name, "(iowa single audit)|(puerto rico)")) %>% 
  
  rename(state.abb = state)

```

### State from Census 2020
```{r}
census_state_2020 <- census_all_2020 %>% filter(sumlev == 40) %>% 
  mutate(FIPS = state, 
         FIPS = ifelse(nchar(FIPS) == 1, paste0(0, FIPS), FIPS))

```

### Joining acfrs states & census states: state_gov_2020
```{r}
state_gov_2020 <- acfrs_state_2020 %>% left_join(census_state_2020) %>% 
  select(-c(27:33, state.name)) 

state_gov_2020 %>% write.csv("output/state_gov_2020.csv")
```


# Extracting Cities and Places: 7111
## Step 1: Get polulation & geoID from Census Cities & Towns

List of cities and places with geoID & population from file "City and Town Mapping.xlsx". We will use this geoID to join with a middle file that has geoID and government_ID. From there get to acfrs data, which has government_ID. 

Don't use the above file "sub-est2022.csv" because that file does not have geoID. Just use that to check how many cities and places

```{r}
census_all_2020 %>% 
  #filter(sumlev == 162) %>% #Incorporated place
  filter(sumlev == 71) %>% 
  #filter(funcstat == "A") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "silver spring"))

```


```{r}
#Marc emailed this data Feb2 2022: using 017 Census master file data to map to the 2020 Census Population data using FIPS Codes. GEO_ID: Census identifiers that point to population of places in US
city_place_census_2020 <- rio::import(here::here("data", "City and Town Mapping.xlsx"), sheet = 2) %>% 
rename(population = `!!Total:`, 
       geoID = GEO_ID) %>% 
  separate(NAME, c("city_place", "state.name"), sep = ",")  %>%  
  mutate(state.name = str_trim(state.name), 
         city_place = str_trim(city_place),
         city_place = str_to_lower(city_place)) %>% 
  left_join(df_state) %>% drop_na() 
 
```

There are `r nrow(pop)` observations in this data set. 

## Step 2: Get a middle file that has government_ID and geoID

ACFRs database uses government ID (enumeration ID of local governments), but data does not use FIP codes, and does not have geo_id. 
We use a Census master file data to map ACFRs to the 2020 Census Population data by FIPS Codes.

```{r}
#government_ID (used in ACFRs): enumeration ID of local governments. 
# Note that population data is ACFRs portal is 2017 -> don't use
# Note: census_id, which means government_id in Acfrs are numeric --> can be turn to scientific notation in R --> will not match --> need to avoid scientific notation. 

# This middle file has both government_ID and geo_id
middle_file_governmentID_geoID <- rio::import(here::here("data", "City and Town Mapping.xlsx"), sheet = 3) %>% 
  select(government_ID, `INFERRED GEO_ID`, NAME, CITY, STATE_AB, COUNTY_AREA_NAME)  %>% 
  rename(geoID = `INFERRED GEO_ID`,  # Marc created INFERRED GEO_ID, which meant to be geoID
         original_name = NAME, 
         state.abb = STATE_AB) %>% 
  mutate(original_name = str_to_lower(original_name))
```

## Step 3: Linking census population to middle file government_ID and geoID
city_place_census_2020 has population & geoID 
middle_file_governmentID_geoID has geoID and government_ID
ACFRs has governement_ID 
```{r}
# join city_place_census_2020 with the middle file to get population into that middle file. 
governmentID_geoID_population <- city_place_census_2020 %>% # has population
  left_join(middle_file_governmentID_geoID) %>% # middle file
  drop_na(government_ID) 

# governmentID_geoID_population now has population, governement_ID and geoID
```

## Step 4: Join ACFRs to census population by government_ID

* Take all acfrs general purpose, less states, to join with governmentID_geoID_population. The result would be acfrs cities and places with geoID and population data. 

```{r}
# join acfrs general purpose with city and town population data that has governmentID
acfrs_city_place_pop_20 <- acfrs_general_purpose %>% 
  filter(!id %in% state_gov_2020$id) %>% # take out state entities 
  
  left_join(governmentID_geoID_population) %>% 
  drop_na(population) %>%   # 7110 obs
  select(state.abb, 2:27, population, city_place)
#does this include state and counties? No. This list is only city and place

#Even some names contains word "county", it actually a town. For example: "halifax county" in acfrs is in fact a town (population 1000) of Halifax county (pop more than 30k)

# macon-bibb county pop is correct --> why???
#acfrs_city_pop %>% filter(str_detect(name, "county"))

acfrs_city_place_pop_20 %>% write.csv("output/city_place_gov_20.csv")


# check some city as county - are they included in list acfrs_city_place_pop_20?
#Yes: baltimore city MD, alexandria city VA
census_cityAScounty_2020 
acfrs_city_place_pop_20 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "(alexandria)|(baltimore)"))
```

# Extracting counties
Second half of ACFRs general purpose: 5121 Acfrs_NOT_cityplace 

Acfrs general purpose excluding cities and places
```{r}
# the rest of acfrs general purpose, has government unit ID, but do not have geo ID --> now join by name in the list of census name file 
# risk of matching my name: identical names in different state --> wrong join

acfrs_NOT_cityplace <- acfrs_general_purpose %>% # total 12,231
  filter(!id %in% acfrs_city_place_pop_20$id) %>%  # 5121 obs, excludes 7110 in city list above
rename(state.abb = state)
```

### Census counties

```{r}
census_county_2020 <-  census_all_2020 %>% 
   filter(sumlev == 050) %>% # county level
  rename(county_code = county) %>% 
  mutate(county_code = case_when(nchar(county_code) == 1 ~ paste0(0,0, county_code),
                                 nchar(county_code) == 2 ~ paste0(0, county_code),
                                 nchar(county_code) == 3 ~ as.character(county_code)),
                        
               state = case_when(nchar(state) == 1 ~ paste0(0, state),
                                 TRUE ~ as.character(state)),
         FIPS = paste0(state, county_code))
         
  write.csv(census_county_2020, "census_documents/census_3144county_2020.csv")

# Check special cases: 
city_as_county_census <- census_county_2020 %>% 
  # 41 cities & district of columbia categorized as county
  filter(!str_detect(name, "(borough)|(county)|(parish)|(planning regio)|(census area)|(municipality)")) 
# Note: Planning Regio, lacking "n" at last, to include all Planning Region in CT

#Louisiana has 64 entities "Parish"
# Alaska has 30 entities " 17 Borough", "Census Area", "Municipality"
# Connecticut has 9 entities "Planning Region"

```

## Counties from ACFRs
### Step 1: filter for counties from ACFRs
```{r}
acfrs_county <- acfrs_NOT_cityplace %>% 
  filter(grepl("county|municipality", name)) %>% 
  
  # correct some simple spelling errors
  mutate(name = case_when(name == "dona ana county" ~ "doÃ±a ana county", 
                          TRUE ~ name)) 

acfrs_county %>% filter(str_detect(name, "(?i)la paz"))
```

### Step 2: Special cases of county level 
#### Louisiana

In Louisiana, counties are called Parishes.

```{r}
louisiana_parish <- acfrs_NOT_cityplace %>% 
  filter(state.abb == "LA") %>% 
  filter(grepl("parish", name))
```

#### Alaska

Not a single easy way to fill out counties and equivalents in Alaska. Census counts 30 counties in 3 types: Borough, Municipality, Census Area.

```{r}
# Get Alaska counties in census
alaska_county_census <- census_county_2020 %>% 
  filter(state.name == "Alaska") %>% 
  mutate(name = str_remove_all(name, "city and borough"), 
         name = str_remove_all(name, "(borough)|(census area)|(municipality)"),
         name = str_to_lower(name),
         name = str_squish(name))

#NOTE: Both city and borough:
#"sitka city and borough", "wrangell city and borough", "yakutat city and borough"
```

```{r}
# use the list of Alaska counties in census to find counties in acfrs:
alaska_borough_acfrs <- acfrs_NOT_cityplace %>% 
  filter(state.abb == "AK") %>% 
  mutate(name = str_remove_all(name, "borough"),
         name = str_to_lower(name),
         name = str_squish(name)) %>% 

  filter(name %in% alaska_county_census$name) %>% arrange(name)

```

### Step 3: Binding counties, parish, borough together
```{r}
# first, join entities in ACFRs contain words "County" + Louisiana that contain word "Parish" + alaska that contain "Borough" in their names
acfrs_county_parish_borough <- rbind(acfrs_county, louisiana_parish) %>% 
                              rbind(alaska_borough_acfrs) %>% 
  
  # cleaning to match with names in census
  mutate(name = str_remove_all(name, " fiscal court"))

```

### Step 4: Joining ACFRS counties with Census counties  
```{r}
# join acfrs with census population by = c("state.abb", "county")
county_pop_census_acfrs_20 <- acfrs_county_parish_borough %>% 
            left_join(census_county_2020, by = c("state.abb", "name")) %>% 
            arrange(desc(population)) %>% 
            drop_na(population) 

county_pop_census_acfrs_20 %>% write.csv("output/county_gov_20.csv")
county_pop_census_acfrs_20 %>% filter(str_detect(name, "(?i)la paz"))
```

# Remaining acfrs_NOT_cityplace_NOT_county:  acfrs_NOT_cityplace less county_pop_census_acfrs

```{r}
acfrs_geoID_NO_population_20 <- acfrs_NOT_cityplace %>% 
  filter(!id %in% county_pop_census_acfrs_20$id) %>%  # filter out counties
  
  # join again with the middle file link governmentID and geoID
  left_join(middle_file_governmentID_geoID) %>% # middle file
  drop_na(geoID) %>% #%>% 
  
  mutate(original_name = str_to_lower(original_name)) #%>% 
  #select(-c(27:30)) %>% 

  # check how many of these are town
  #filter(str_detect(original_name, "(township of)|(town of)"))

  
  acfrs_geoID_NO_population_20 %>% write.csv("output/acfrs_geoID_NO_population_20.csv")

  
 other_entities_20 <-  acfrs_NOT_cityplace %>% 
  filter(!id %in% county_pop_census_acfrs_20$id) %>%
    filter(!id %in% acfrs_geoID_NO_population_20$id) 
```
## Number of missing county - broken down by state
```{r}
local_gov_type_state_17 <- rio::import(here::here("data/table2_Local Governments by Type and State_2017/COG2017_CG1700ORG02_Data.xlsx")) %>% clean_names() 

# Municipal Governments
census_county_gov_count <- local_gov_type_state_17 %>% 
filter(agg_desc_ttl == "Total Local Government Units - County Governments") %>% 
  select(geo_ttl, amount) %>% 
  slice(2:51) %>% 
  rename(census_num_county_gov = amount,
         state.name = geo_ttl)
  
```

```{r}
acfrs_county_gov_count <- county_pop_census_acfrs_20 %>% 
  select(state.name, name) %>% 
  group_by(state.name) %>% 
  add_count() %>% 
  arrange(state.name) %>% select(-name) %>% 
  rename(acfrs_num_county_gov = n) %>% 
  distinct() 
```

```{r}
census_county_gov_count %>% left_join(acfrs_county_gov_count) %>% 
  mutate(num_missing_county = as.numeric(census_num_county_gov) - acfrs_num_county_gov) %>% write.csv("num_missing_county.csv")
```
## Number of Municipal Governments - broken down by state
```{r}
# Municipal Governments
census_municipal_gov_count <- local_gov_type_state_17 %>% 
filter(agg_desc_ttl == "Total Local Government Units - Subcounty Governments - Municipal Governments") %>% 
  select(geo_ttl, amount) %>% 
  slice(2:51) %>% 
  rename(census_num_municipal_gov = amount,
         state.name = geo_ttl)
  19495
```

```{r}
acfrs_municipal_gov_count <- acfrs_city_place_pop_20 %>% left_join(df_state) %>% 
  select(state.name, name) %>% 
  group_by(state.name) %>% 
  add_count() %>% 
  arrange(state.name) %>% select(-name) %>% 
  rename(acfrs_num_municipal_gov = n) %>% 
  distinct() 
```

```{r}
census_municipal_gov_count %>% left_join(acfrs_municipal_gov_count) %>% 
  mutate(num_missing_municipal = as.numeric(census_num_municipal_gov) - acfrs_num_municipal_gov) %>% write.csv("num_missing_municipal.csv")
```

```{r}
# Township Governments
local_gov_type_state_17 %>% 
filter(agg_desc_ttl == "" |
       agg_desc_ttl  == "Total Local Government Units - Subcounty Governments - Township Governments") %>% 
  select(geo_ttl, amount)
```


```{r}
  # Problem when join 
  left_join(census_all_2020, by = c("name", "state")) %>% # inflated when join with census
  
  
  rename(population = popestimate2020) %>% select(-state.name) %>%  
select(name, state, population) %>% distinct() # 3835 
  
# example of inflated join: 1 acfrs name ~ many census names - don't know which acfrs corresponds to which census entity
  acfrs_general_purpose %>% # total 12,231
  filter(!government_ID %in% acfrs_city_place_pop$government_ID) %>% # 5121 obs, excludes 7110 in city list above
  select(state, name, government_ID, total_liabilities) %>% filter(name == "west branch township") # --> only 1
  
    filter(name == "west branch township") #--> census has many "west branch township" MI as minor civil divisions in different counties in the same state. Acfrs only have 9 instances inwhich the name of entities are note which county they belong to: 
    acfrs_general_purpose %>% filter(str_detect(name, "county\\)"))
  
    
### Does acfrs_rest_pop include state and counties? Yes. 
acfrs_city_place_pop %>% filter(str_detect(name, "michigan"))
acfrs_rest_pop %>% filter(str_detect(name, "michigan"))
acfrs_general_purpose %>%filter(str_detect(name, "michigan"))


# Take state and county out of acfrs_rest_pop
acfrs_rest_pop %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(name, "state of")) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(name, "(county)")) %>% 
  
  distinct(name, state, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  ## The remaining 2616 entities 
filter(is.na(population)) %>%  # of which 2616 - 1429 = 1187 do not have population
arrange(state)

```


At this point Acfrs now has `r nrow(acfrs_governmentID)` general purpose entities FY 2020, of which 6810 are cities and towns. 


## Checking for overlapping 

Check if there's any overlapping between the above lists

```{r}
# all general purpose entities: 11187
length(unique(acfrs_governmentID$government_ID)) 

unique(acfrs_governmentID$government_ID) -> t1

# cities and towns: 6810
length(unique(acfrs_city_pop$government_ID)) 
unique(acfrs_city_pop$government_ID) ->t2

# gap bw the 2 above: 4377
length(unique(setdiff(t1, t2)))

# list of counties (in count_gov.Rmd): 2569
county_pop_census_acfrs <- readRDS("county_pop_census_acfrs.RDS")
length(unique(county_pop_census_acfrs$census_id))
unique(county_pop_census_acfrs$census_id) ->t3

# entities overlapping  between city list and county list

intersect(t2, t3) -> intersect_city_county

# view the overlapping cities 
acfrs_city_pop %>% filter(government_ID %in% intersect_city_county) %>% 
 select(name, government_ID)

```
Those whose names contain parentheses are actually cities. The part in side the parentheses indicates which county they belong to. 



Lastly, take 15 who are actually counties out of the cities list. 
```{r}
# actually county
  acfrs_city_pop %>% filter(government_ID %in% intersect_city_county) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("\\)", name)) -> actual_county

acfrs_city_pop_final <- acfrs_city_pop %>% 
  filter(!government_ID %in% actual_county$government_ID) 

datatable(acfrs_city_pop_final)

 saveRDS(acfrs_city_pop_final, "acfrs_city_pop.RDS")
 
 acfrs_city_pop_final %>% arrange(desc(population)) %>% slice(1:10) -> top10_city_2020
 top10_city_2020 %>% write.csv("top10_city_2020.csv")
```


```{r}
# missing Philadelphia PA
readRDS("data/data_from_dbsite_2021.RDS") %>% 
   filter(id %in% top10_city_2020$id) %>% write.csv("top10_city_2021.csv")
```

The list of city and county contains `r nrow(acfrs_city_pop_final)` entities. 

Another approach: 

Subtract all states and counties from general purpose

```{r}
state_gov <- readRDS("state_gov.RDS")
counties <- readRDS("counties.RDS") 

gen_purpose <- readRDS("data/data_from_dbsite_2020.RDS") %>% 
  filter(category == "General Purpose")  
  
gen_purpose %>% 
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>% 
  # take out state gov
  filter(!id %in% state_gov$id) %>% 
  
  # take out county %>% 
  filter(!id %in% counties$id.x)
  
  # check id in city and county

length(setdiff(acfrs_city_pop_final$id, counties$id.x))

#over lapping city and county
length(intersect(acfrs_city_pop_final$id, counties$id))
  
```

```{r}
nrow(counties)
slices <- c(51, nrow(counties), nrow(gen_purpose) - nrow(counties))
lbls <- c("state", "county", "city and township")

lbls <- paste(lbls,":", slices, "entities")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Share of entities in General Purpose")

```


```{r}
slices <- c(51, nrow(counties), nrow(acfrs_city_pop_final), nrow(gen_purpose) - nrow(counties)-nrow(acfrs_city_pop_final))
lbls <- c("state", "county", "city and township \nwith pop data", "city and township \nw/o pop data")

lbls <- paste(lbls,":", slices, "entities")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="Share of entities in General Purpose with \nand w/o population data")
```

```{r}
# general purpose w/o pop data:
gen_purpose %>% 
  filter(!id %in% state_gov$id) %>% 
  filter(!id %in% counties$id.x) %>% 
  filter(!id %in% acfrs_city_pop_final$id) %>% 
  select(id, name, state, total_liabilities, net_pension_liability) %>% 
  # 
   # filter(total_liabilities > 500000000) %>% # 33 entities is 5 hundred mil a resonable cut? Using total or using net_pension
   # arrange(desc(total_liabilities)) -> t_1

# Using total or using net_pension
  # arrange(desc(net_pension_liability)) %>%
